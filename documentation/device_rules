USB DEVICE NAMES REFERENCE LIST

----------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------

Front mounted main SICK lidar is called /dev/sensor-sick_lidar
And device name is implemented here:
/home/babs/ros_ws/src/babs/launchers/launch/start_lidar.launch

Front mounted hokuyo lidar for wobbler is called /dev/sensor-front_wobbler_lidar 
And the device name is implemented here:
/home/babs/ros_ws/src/babs/packages/wobbler/babs_lidar_wobbler/launch/start_wobbler.launch (same as motor)

Device for both dynamixel motors (daisy chained) is called /dev/sensor-wobbler_motors
And the device name is implemented here:
/home/babs/ros_ws/src/babs/packages/wobbler/babs_lidar_wobbler/launch/start_wobbler.launch (same as lidar)
NOTE: This motor gets two symlinks, the actual one used is /dev/ttyUSB999 because the Dynamixel driver requires this format.

Roboteq Motor Controller unit is...

GPS Receiver is called /dev/sensor-gps
And the device name is implemented here:
/home/babs/ros_ws/src/babs/packages/novatel/launch/novatel_for_psr.launch

Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is called /dev/sensor-imu
And the device name is implemented here:
/home/babs/ros_ws/src/babs/packages/razor_imu_9dof/config/razor.yaml
